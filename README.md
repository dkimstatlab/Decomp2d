# Decomp2d
R package for two-dimensional decomposition 

The subjects of image processing include feature extraction, compression, denoising, image enhancement, and restoration. 
Many software have been developed for these studies. However, few studies have focused on decomposition in the literature, 
even though image decomposition is essential for image processing. 
We provide an R solution termed "Decomp2d", tailored to the viewpoint of image decomposition based on existing R packages.

The "Decomp2d" solution can be installed through the following commands.

> install.packages("devtools")

> devtools::install_github("dkimstatlab/Decomp2d")

> library(Decomp2d)
